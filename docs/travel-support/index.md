# Travel support
UbuCon Asia Committee provides some travel support to select participants who applied for and were approved in advance. Largely, there are 2 types of travel support.

## Travel grant
This program provides travel funding for approved applicants. Full or partial funding for your round trip travel(flight, train, ferry or other) and accommodation for staying during the event is provided.

## Visa invitation
Not all participants can visit the hosting country without a visa, for those who need our visa invitation and got a visa invitation request approved in advance, the Local team will provide visa invitation letter along with other documents (such as an event brochure) as well as guidance on applying for visa.

Note - Submitting the visa invitation request as soon as possible is always a good idea, as some countries requires approval of invitation letters from concerned ministries before it can be used.
